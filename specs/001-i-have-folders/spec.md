# Feature Specification: Media File Organization by Creation Date

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-have-folders`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I have folders where picture and video files from devices have been dumped. They are not sorted and all dumped in a folder by device name. I would like an application that can go through the folder and move each file into a folder that represents the month and date that the media file was created. Example: 05.2025 representing May 2025. Put this new folder in the same device folder and create it, if it doesn't already exist. To determine which folder the file should go in, take the created date of the file and move it based on the month and year of the creation date. When you move a file before deleting the source file, make sure that it 100% has been copied over to the new location before deleting the current one. These files cannot be recovered, so you must absolutely be sure that a file has been correctly moved before deleting any file. You will run until all the files in the folder have been moved into their respective month/year folder. When looking at the file dates, use the creation date as the main date for reference."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users with unsorted media files
   ‚Üí Actions: Scan folders, read creation dates, organize by month/year
   ‚Üí Data: Picture and video files from various devices
   ‚Üí Constraints: Safe file movement with verification, non-recoverable files
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: Select folder ‚Üí Process files ‚Üí Organize by date
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
   ‚Üí Ambiguous requirements marked
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Media files, device folders, date-based folders
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with unsorted media files from multiple devices, I want to organize my photos and videos into folders based on when they were created, so that I can easily find media from specific time periods without manually sorting thousands of files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a folder containing mixed media files from a device, **When** the user runs the organization process, **Then** all files are moved to folders named MM.YYYY based on their creation date
2. **Given** a media file with creation date of March 15, 2024, **When** the organization process runs, **Then** the file is moved to a folder named "03.2024" within the same device folder
3. **Given** a file is being moved, **When** the copy operation completes successfully, **Then** the original file is deleted only after verification that the file exists in the destination
4. **Given** multiple files with the same creation month/year, **When** the organization process runs, **Then** all files are placed in the same MM.YYYY folder
5. **Given** a date-based folder doesn't exist, **When** a file needs to be moved there, **Then** the folder is created automatically before moving the file

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file creation date cannot be determined - use modification date, current date, or skip file]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: duplicate filenames in destination folder - rename, overwrite, or skip]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: insufficient disk space during copy operation]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: files currently in use or locked by another process]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: mixed file types beyond photos/videos are present - process all files or filter by type]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: corrupted files that cannot be read or copied]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read the creation date from media files (photos and videos)
- **FR-002**: System MUST create folders using the format MM.YYYY (e.g., "05.2025" for May 2025)
- **FR-003**: System MUST move files to the appropriate month/year folder based on creation date
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify successful file copy before deleting the original file
- **FR-005**: System MUST create date-based folders within the same device folder as the source files
- **FR-006**: System MUST process all files in the selected folder until completion
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which file types specifically - only images/videos or all files]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: progress indication or completion notification]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: nested folders - process recursively or only top level]
- **FR-010**: System MUST log or report [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: errors, skipped files, or summary of operations]
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single folder at a time or batch processing of multiple device folders]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file naming conflicts - append number, timestamp, or other strategy]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Media File**: Represents a photo or video file with associated metadata including creation date, file path, and size
- **Device Folder**: The source folder containing unsorted media files from a specific device
- **Date Folder**: The destination folder named in MM.YYYY format where files are organized by creation month and year
- **File Operation**: Represents the move operation including source path, destination path, and verification status
